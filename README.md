# DBox - DB Toolbox
## A simple migration manager written in Go.

Originally custom-made for my own Go backend project, so the file structure might be a bit weird.

# Setup:
**Make sure you have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install).**

Clone this repo, then build it:
```
go build dbox.go
```
If you're missing any packages, just run:
```
go mod tidy
```
It'll install everything you need.

That's it.

### **Enjoy!**
